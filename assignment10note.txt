Package: Su2022 (I named my open package by this name)
Title: State-wise Covid19 cases analysis in India
Version: 0.1
Authors: Sudeepthi Vejendla, sudeepthivejendla@usf.edu
Description: 
Through this package, we analyze state-wise reported Covid19 cases with the obtained data by performing different numerical and 
descriptive methods to find several factors like the total number of cases and the subsets in total cases, mean of cases in different states, 
sort the total number of cases in order to get the top five states with the highest number of cases. 
Also visualization of this Covid19 data with descriptive commands showing the data graphically with pie-charts and graphs, etc. 
This dataset consists of multiple variables which can be compared with each other to do the complete analysis. 
My final motto is to deliver the overall covid19 spread in India by analyzing all the given factors.
Depends: R version 3.1.4 packages
License: CCO, to keep my package open
Lazydata: True
